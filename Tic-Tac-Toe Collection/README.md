There's 4 modes currently available to play
1. Classic
2. Notako
3. Wild
4. Ultimate

# Classic

- Just like the classic Tic Tac Toe, you know what to do :)

# Notako

- Each player takes turns placing an X on the board(s) in a vacant space (a space not occupied by a X already on the board).
- When one player creates a three-in-a-row, that player loses the game.

# Wild

- Each of the players take turns placing a X or an O on any unoccupied square.
- The player who creates a line of three Xs or Os is the winner of the game.

# Ultimate

- Each small 3-by-3 tic-tac-toe board is referred to as a local board, and the larger 3-by-3 board is referred to as the global board.
- The game starts with X playing wherever he wants in any of the 81 empty spots.
- If a move is played so that it is to win a local board by the rules of normal tic-tac-toe, then it wins that local board.
- Once the outcome of a local board is decided (win or draw), no more moves may be played in that board.
- Game play ends when either a player wins the global board, or there are no legal moves remaining.

# Quantum
